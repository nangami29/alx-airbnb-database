# SQL Join Queries – Airbnb Database

## Overview
This script (`joins_queries.sql`) demonstrates advanced SQL JOIN operations on the `airbnb_db` database.  
It includes examples of:

1. **INNER JOIN** – retrieves only matching rows between tables.
2. **LEFT JOIN** – retrieves all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table.
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN (simulated)** – retrieves all rows from both tables, including unmatched rows.

These queries are designed for practice and to better understand how different types of joins work.
